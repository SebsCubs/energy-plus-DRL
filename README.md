# eplus-DRL

### This library was created to allow for quick prototyping, training and testing of building control strategies based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). It is heavily inspired by mechyai's [RL-EmsPy library](https://github.com/mechyai/RL-EmsPy). I attempted to provide a more streamlined process to create different control strategies, enable parallelization, plotting, versioning and a more complete release in general.

*Any feedback or improvements to the repo are welcome.*
